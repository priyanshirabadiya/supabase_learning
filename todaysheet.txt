Policies (RLS) – Created a policy using USING (true) and WITH CHECK (true) to allow public access.

.eq(), .neq(), .gt(), .lt(), .gte(), .lte(), .like(), .ilike(), .is(), .in(), .not(), .or(), .filter(), .match() – All filter methods used in Supabase queries.

Dynamic Filters – Applied filters conditionally in Next.js based on user input.

Supabase SQL Editor – Ran SQL queries like SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 25.
