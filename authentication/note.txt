ðŸ§  What is Authentication?
Authentication means verifying who the user is.

Supabase provides built-in authentication with:

Email/password login

Social login (Google, GitHub, etc.)

Magic links

OTP login (phone/email)

Supabase handles the backend auth for you â€” no need to build your own login system.
