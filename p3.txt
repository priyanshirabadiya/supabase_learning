✅ What is Supabase Auth?
Supabase Auth is an authentication and authorization system built on top of PostgreSQL, providing user management and secure access with methods like:

Email & password login

Social logins (Google, GitHub, etc.)

Magic links (passwordless)

Phone OTP login

Server-side and client-side auth management



About authentication and authorization#
Authentication and authorization are the core responsibilities of any Auth system.

Authentication means checking that a user is who they say they are.
Authorization means checking what resources a user is allowed to access.
Supabase Auth uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for authentication. For a complete reference of all JWT fields, see the JWT Fields Reference. Auth integrates with Supabase's database features, making it easy to use Row Level Security (RLS) for authorization.
